## How to Install

1. Install any live wallpaper app for your OS that supports Website/HTML.

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend using [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively), another Free And Open Source Software _(FOSS)_. I don't provide setup support for any other wallpaper app.

2. Copy the GitHub Pages URL or download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SpoiledUnknown/Natsuki-Live/releases/) and extract it to your desired location.

3. Set it inside the wallpaper app:
   1. Open **Lively Wallpaper**.
   2. Click on the plus (+) button in the top right.
   3. Select the wallpaper.
   4. Enter the name and description
      - Adding a name and description helps you remember and distinguish between your other wallpapers
   5. rescale the thumbnail _(Optional)_.
      - This also helps in remembering and distinguishing.
   6. You are good to **GO!**

## Changelog:

### Version - 0.7.0

- Fixed several spelling mistakes and typos across the entire project.
- Fixed several bad image editing artifacts.
- Added support for all 16:9 ratio displays
  - Support for 16:10 is also in development and will come with v0.7.1
- Added a completely new reaction `Surpised Natsuki`
- Added support for Automatic rescaling based on both Image Size and Screen Size
  - Automatically determines which one will provide the best looking result and use that instead.
- Reduced the size from 12.7mb to just 6.4mb `Nearly 50%` while extending functionality.
- Added a config.json file for easy editing of the values.
- Wallpaper is mostly frameRate independent now (Only for 30, 60 and 120).

Also I am considering a Natsuki Live wallpaper for Mobile/Android devices as well, which will have toned down interaction as well. This was originally suggested by [u/Superb_Temporary_258](https://www.reddit.com/user/Superb_Temporary_258/) from DDLC subreddit. Since I lack the technical skills and a development device that could handle Android Studio, so I can't make it right now but maybe in the future.

And yeah, no IOS wallpaper since Apple doesn't allow this much freedom. Better get Panels subscription then `jk ;)`
