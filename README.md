## How to Install

1. Install any live wallpaper app for your OS that supports Website/HTML.

> [!NOTE]
> I recommend using [Lively Wallpaper](https://github.com/rocksdanister/lively), another Free And Open Source Software _(FOSS)_. I don't provide setup support for any other wallpaper app.

2. Copy the GitHub Pages URL or download the zip from the [releases](https://github.com/SpoiledUnknown/Natsuki-Live/releases/tag/v0.6.8) and extract it to your desired location.

3. Set it inside the wallpaper app:
   1. Open **Lively Wallpaper**.
   2. Click on the plus (+) button in the top right.
   3. Select the wallpaper _(Optional)_.
   4. Enter the name and description
      - Adding a name and description helps you remember and distinguish between you other wallpapers
   5. rescale the thumbnail _(Optional)_.
      - This also helps in remembering and distinguishing.
   6. You are good to **GO!**

## How set correct Screen Resolution

### Method 1 (Easy):

1. Open the **_main.js_** file in text editor (like vscode or notepad)
2. Find and change the screen width and height to your screen's native resolution in variables

```javascript
const screenWidth = 1366;
const screenHeight = 768;
```

> [!NOTE]

### Method 2 :

1. Open **_public_** folder.
2. Resize the images to your screens native resolution.
3. Find and change the screen width and height to your screen's native resolution in variables

```javascript
const screenWidth = 1366;
const screenHeight = 768;
```

> [!NOTE]

4. Just below width and height variable, change the imageWidth variable to the one you changed in Step 2.

```javascript
const imageWidth = 2548;
```

5. thats it!

> [!NOTE]
> Doesn't matter which method you use, you still have to change the following variables

```javascript
const deadZoneXMin = 665;
const deadZoneXMax = 710;
const deadZoneYMin = 368;
const deadZoneYMax = 400;
const snapThreshold = 3;
```

> Goodluck!!
